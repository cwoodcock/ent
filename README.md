# ENT - A Pseudorandom Number Sequence Test Program

ent applies various tests to sequences of bytes stored in files and reports the results of those tests.

The program is useful for evaluating pseudorandom number generators for encryption and statistical sampling applications, compression algorithms, and other applications where the information density of a file is of interest.

This is a fork of the upstream code and modifies the terse output to include probability information and condense output.
